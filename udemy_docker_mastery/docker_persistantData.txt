-Containers are usually immutable / unchangeable
-"immutable infrastructure": only re-deploy containers, never change
-This is ideal, but what about databases or unique data?
-Docker gives us features to ensure these "separation of concerns"

-Known as "persistent data", and there are two ways in docker:
    1) Volumes: make special location outside of container UFS
    2) Bind Mounts: link the container path to some directory on the host machine
