Docker Image Tags
- Images don't technically have names. Really 3 pieces of info
    Repository: format => name/organization
    Tag: pointer to a specific image commit [i.e., 5, 2.14, latest]

# add a new tag locally
>docker image tag <SOURCE_IMAGE>[:TAG] <TARGET_IMAGE>[:TAG]

# push an image to the repo
>docker login
>docker image push <SOURCE_IMAGE>[:TAG]

# optional, but will clear your auth keys from the machine
>docker logout
