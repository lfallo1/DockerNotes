Docker Bind Mounts
-maps a host file or dir to a container file or dir
-basically just two locations pointing to same file(s)
-again, skips UFS, and host files overwrite any in container
-can't use in Dockerfile, must be at container run
    i.e., docker container run -v <<host_path>>:<<container_path>> (mac/linux)
          docker container run -v /Users/lfallon/stuff:/path/container (mac/linux)
